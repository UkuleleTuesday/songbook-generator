    "# Difficulty Binning Analysis with Real Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the current difficulty binning algorithm used in the songbook generator and visualizes how it behaves with real song data from Google Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The current binning logic (from `generator/worker/difficulty.py`) uses a **relative approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the minimum difficulty value among all songs\n",
    "2. Use a hardcoded maximum of 5.0\n",
    "3. Normalize all difficulties to a 0-1 range: `(difficulty - min) / (5.0 - min)`\n",
    "4. Digitize into bins using `np.linspace(0, 1, num_bins + 1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that bin assignments are **relative to the current song selection** - the same song can be assigned different bins depending on what other songs are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize how the current algorithm distributes real songs from Google Drive into bins\n",
    "- Explore how bin assignments change with different real song selections\n",
    "- Compare the relative approach with possible absolute schemes using real data\n",
    "- Identify inconsistencies and edge cases in the live songbook collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires Google Cloud authentication with service account impersonation permissions. Ensure you have:\n",
    "1. Authenticated with `gcloud auth application-default login`\n",
    "2. Permission to impersonate the songbook-generator service account\n",
    "3. Access to the Google Drive folder containing song sheets\n"

    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of real song data from Google Drive, this notebook demonstrates several critical issues with the current difficulty binning algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö® Key Issues Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inconsistent binning**: The same song gets different bin assignments depending on what other songs are in the collection\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to outliers**: Adding very hard songs shifts all existing song assignments\n",
    "3. **Over-amplification**: Small difficulty ranges get exaggerated across the full bin spread\n",
    "4. **Context dependency**: Bin assignments are not predictable or stable\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement absolute binning** with fixed difficulty ranges (e.g., 1.0-1.5 = Bin 1, 1.5-2.5 = Bin 2, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Consider percentile-based binning** using historical data to ensure consistent distribution\n",
    "3. **Add configuration options** for binning method selection\n",
    "4. **Expand test coverage** for the identified edge cases\n",
    "5. **Monitor binning consistency** in production to detect when algorithms produce unexpected results\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis with real data provides concrete evidence that the current relative approach creates unpredictable user experiences and should be replaced with a more stable algorithm.\n"
